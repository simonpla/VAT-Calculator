# VAT-Calculator
Calculates VAT from and to values, with flexible input methods, like importing hundreds of values from CSV files.

It is powered by wxWidgets, a cross-platform GUI library for C++.
It uses cmake for easy compilation on Windows, macOS and Linux, credits to [JustDevTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4Q-KGKCeFbBpaAqwllCDqQ) and his [wx_cmake_template](https://github.com/lszl84/wx_cmake_template).
